      <p>
        The FPGA Design Project is part of the EE2026 Digital Design course,
        which is conducted in Verilog. The topic of both individual and team
        components of the project is open-ended, and is mainly restricted by
        equipment, which included an OLED display, an Audio Input module, an
        Audio Output module and a mouse.<br /><br />
        Our tasks were to each create individual features, which is later on
        integrated together with that of the other members.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h3>Individual Component</h3>
      <p>
        In Verilog, implemented a piano with toggle-based keys ranging from C to
        B. The series of keys implemented excludes sharps and flats due to the
        limited number of switches on the board. When multiple switches are on
        at the same time, audio played will be the combination of notes
        represented by the switches. <br /><br />
        The Octave can be controlled using the up and down buttons on the board.
        The Octaves playable is restricted based on the average hearing range of
        a person.
