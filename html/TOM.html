        Taste of Mom's (TOM) is a desktop recipe manager application for
        managing recipes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface
        (CLI).<br /><br />
        Our application will help students to keep track and modify recipes
        which they can learn to cook, so that they can enjoy the same taste of
        food made like as if they were at home as they live on campus. It also
        helps them filter recipes with ease.<br /><br />
